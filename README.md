# Simulations app

Dash app with simulations to test the Central Limit Theorem (CTL) and the Law of Large Numbers (LLN).

## Description

The user can choose the size of the random sample ($n$) and the probability ($p$). Then, a thousand random samples of size $n$ are created with each observation distributed $Bernoulli(p)$. 
For each random sample, we compute the mean sample. Finally, we plot the distribution of the mean sample.
